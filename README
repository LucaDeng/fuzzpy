-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

FuzzPy is a library for fuzzy sets, fuzzy graphs, and general fuzzy mathematics
for Python.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS

FuzzPy requires Python (2.6 or later).

http://www.python.org

Additionally, Epydoc is required for generating documentation.

http://epydoc.sourceforge.net

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API DOCUMENTATION

API documentation can be generated with Epydoc using the provided gendoc.sh
script. This will create a subdirectory 'doc' containing full API documentation
in HTML format.

DEVELOPMENT

FuzzPy is in a relatively early stage of development, and is changing rapidly.
Functional compatibility may be broken between releases, even revisions in some
cases. Once the project is reasonably feature-complete and best practices are
established, the 1.x release series will begin, and the project will transition
into a policy of not breaking functional compatibility across releases with the
same minor version.

If you would like to help with development, please contact primary developer
Aaron Mavrinac to get access to the GitHub repositories and Google Code project
page.
